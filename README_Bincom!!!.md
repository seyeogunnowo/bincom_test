Greetings Bincom

Thank you for the opportunity. I have experience working with PostgreSQL, not MySQL, as such, inorder to submit the project, I had to reformat the SQL file into Django's default sqlite3 file. I would have reformatted to PostgreSQL however, that would require the assessor to install PostgreSQL on his system and upload the CSV files to the DB tables.

Thank you!
